    <h2>A Totally Real and Not Suspicious Story</h2>
    <p>
      Once upon a time on the spaceship Skeld, everything was totally normal. Red was vibing in Electrical (aka the danger zone), Blue was pretending to do tasks, and Yellow was just... spinning in circles for some reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, the lights went out. "Not again!" cried Green, who had been traumatized by wires for years. Red went to fix them, but mysteriously disappeared. When the lights came back on, there was only a banana peel where Red used to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      An emergency meeting was called. Chaos ensued.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's Pink! I saw them vent!" screamed Blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pink stared back, eating Cheetos. "Bruh, I was AFK."
    </p>
    <p>
      The vote was tied. Skipped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spoiler alert: It was Yellow the whole time. Never trust a crewmate who moonwalks into Electrical humming theme music.
