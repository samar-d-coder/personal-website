  <h2>Suspicious Story</h2>
  <p>
    It all started on a quiet day aboard the Skeld. Red was in Admin, definitely not faking card swipe for the 5th time. Green was in MedBay scanning... a sandwich? Blue claimed they were doing tasks, but the only task they were doing was watching TikToks in Navigation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then — bam! Lights out. Classic. Everyone panicked. Someone screamed “IT’S YELLOW!” but there was no Yellow. There never was. A ghost? A glitch? Or just someone forgetting their colors?
  </p>
  <p>
    An emergency meeting was called. No one had evidence, just vibes. Pink was ejected. They were not the impostor. Oops.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the end, it turned out the ship was haunted by the ghost of a rejected crewmate... who just wanted to finish their tasks in peace.
